# Time_Count_Down
This project creates a countdown timer that displays the time remaining until the official launch of a website. Using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic countdown functionality, the timer updates in real time. The user is presented with a visually appealing countdown that shows days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
